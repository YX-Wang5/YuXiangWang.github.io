            <p>Each player receives a board with cartoon representations of 24 individuals and their names, all standing straight, to begin the game. Each player selects a card from a separate pile of the same 24 images to begin the game. To start the game, you must ascertain which card your opponent has selected. To remove candidates, players take turns asking a range of yes-or-no questions, including "Does this person wear glasses?" The candidates will then be eliminated by turning the photos downward until only one is left. Players can rule out one or more potential cards with the help of well-designed questions.</p>
