            <h2>YuXiang Wang</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is YuXiang Wang,I am currently enrolled in computer programming & ayalysis at Seneca College. </p>
		    <p>The reason I choose the game Guess Who? is because this was one of my favourite game to play while growing up, it was also one of the most enjoyed game when I was in elementary school I use to play the game with my friends during breaks and it was a lot of fun. but sadly as I grew older I don't see much people still playing this game.</p>
            <p>I am hoping that this website can help more people to begin enjoying this game instead of playing on their devices too much. </p>
